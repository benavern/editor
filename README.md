#Markdown Editor

####This Readme file was created using the [gh-pages DEMO](http://juliusakula.github.io/editor/#/) of [this project](https://github.com/juliusakula/editor/).

> This allows you to view your rendered Markdown as you type it. No longer do you have to push your readme file to github to see what the rendered text looks like. You can write all your documentation with this tool, and copy and paste to your Readme.md files.

```javascript
var text = "All Markdown features are supported";
console.log(text);
```
